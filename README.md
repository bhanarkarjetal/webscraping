# Web Scraping Projects

This repository contains various web scraping projects showcasing data extraction and manipulation techniques. Each project uses Python libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `lxml`, and `pandas` to demonstrate how to scrape structured data from web pages and manipulate it using dataframes.

## Libraries Used

- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to web pages.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and XML documents and extracting specific elements.
- **lxml**: A powerful library for parsing and navigating XML and HTML structures.
- **pandas**: To create and manipulate dataframes from the scraped data.

## Projects Overview

Each file contains a unique project with its own set of scripts and examples. Hereâ€™s what you can expect in each project:

1. **Data Extraction**: We retrieve structured data like tables, lists, and text content.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and prepare the extracted data for analysis.
3. **Data Manipulation**: Use `pandas` to manipulate the data, including filtering, aggregating, and transforming it for further analysis.
